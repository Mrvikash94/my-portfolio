            <p>
              The idea for ServiceWala came from observing a real-world challenge faced by many people in daily life ‚Äî the difficulty of finding reliable and verified local service providers such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and other technicians, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Most people rely on word-of-mouth recommendations or unverified contacts, which often leads to delays, poor service, or lack of accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to create a solution that would bridge this gap by building a digital platform where customers can easily find and book nearby service professionals based on their city and service needs, and where local workers can get more visibility and job opportunities. The idea was to empower both customers and workers with a transparent, easy-to-use system.
            </p>
            <p>
              ServiceWala is designed as a full-stack web application with features like OTP-based authentication, job posting, service scheduling, and role-based dashboards. It focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and real usability. This project not only demonstrates my technical ability to build scalable web applications but also reflects my interest in solving everyday problems using technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              By developing this platform, I aimed to showcase how tech can make a meaningful impact on local communities while also strengthening my skills in frontend, backend, API integration, and database design.
